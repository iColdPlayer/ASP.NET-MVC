# ASP.NET-MVC
Login Page And Dashboard With .NET Core MVC

This is my first time using ASP.NET Core MVC, and this app is example about how to integrate [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io) with ASP.NET Core MVC. There are a login partial that we need to login to access the admin dashboard, etc.


First, make sure you already have dotnet installed on you pc.

If you haven't installed yet, you follow the instructions for [how to install ASP.NET Core](https://dev.notnoob.com/cara-install-asp.net-pada-linux/) 

You can clone or download this repo and run locally by using this following command :
```
$ git clone https://github.com/iColdPlayer/ASP.NET-MVC.git
$ cd ASP.NET-MVC
$ dotnet run
```
And you're ready to go.
Please feel free to edit or pull request for future use.

Thank's for coming.
